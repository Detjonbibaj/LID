For the purpose of this project, I'm going to limit the scope to just English songs. There may be a deeper correlation that can be made by using all languages, but for readability I chose to limit it to English.

For example, a song can have the line `[Verse 1: Drake]`that follows before a verse sung by Drake. For the purposes of this project, those lines will remain in the lyrics. They aren't technically lyrics, but the AI can notice patterns with artists and verse/chorus/introduction setups to help classify which genre the song is in.\n",

For the sake of simplicity, I will be culling all lyrics tagged as misc from the database even if they are songs, leaving just `rap`, `rb`, `rock`, `pop`, and `country` as the possible genre predictions."

Likely the top word is going to be \"`\\n`\" as it is the 'word' that separates lines in the lyrics, so we will be excluding these in our search. Symbols like brackets and parentheses are also likely to be common with the way we split it up in the previous cells, so we will also be ignoring those. Stop words are also bound to be extremely common, so we will be defining a list of common stop words to ignore. Finally we don't want to see instances of musical notations like `verse` and `chorus` if we want to get an accurate idea of the words our AI will be paying attention to."

        "It's interesting to see how high love is at the top of the list of words. A lot of songs are about love, whether it be for a person or any other thing worth being passionate about. Action words like \"go\" and \"get\" and \"got\" are also very high on the list which makes sense especially since a lot of rap songs are about wealth and possession. I'm also surprised to see that the stop word \"I'm\" was so common that it even made a re-appearance with the incorrect symbol as the apostrophe. If there was any doubt these are community submitted lyrics, it's certainly been squashed."
